# Dynamic Discord Rich Presence Customizer

This is the 8th revival and hopefully the final iteration of this project.

The purpose of this program is to allow the user to set custom Discord rich presence content while being able to dynamically change fields with running programs or your actively playing Spotify track.

## Features

### 0.1.0

-   [x] Custom Discord rich presence
-   [x] Detect target processes
-   [ ] Spotify integration
-   [x] Template variables
-   [ ] An actual CLI
-   [ ] (useful) CLI based help

##### 0.2.0?

-   [ ] IPC for in-depth process data
-   [ ] Custom defined template strings (used with above)

###### Literally never

-   [ ] actually writing good code

## Install

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯\
I'm gonna be honest I don't expect to get this far

## Build

> [!NOTE]
> I haven't done this before and I'm just hoping that these are the correct steps.

You can compile the source code yourself, just make sure you have Rust installed.

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/T1mbits/ddrpc.git
```

Change directories:

```bash
cd ddrpc
```

Build the binary

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary should be in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

jokes on you I've been editing the config file to work this thing

I'll finish the CLI later...
